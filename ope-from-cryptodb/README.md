# OPE from CryptDB

This is the Order-preserving encryption (OPE) lib extracted from the CryptoDB (http://css.csail.mit.edu/cryptdb/).

With this it is not necessary to compile the whole CryptDB to use the OPE lib.


Take a look to ```example.cpp``` and to ```Makefile``` to see how to use and compile this lib.
